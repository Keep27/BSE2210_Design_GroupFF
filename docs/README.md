## Contributions  

- **Ndame Sepete (2410559):**  
  Worked on explaining software design as a process and an artifact. Prepared the UML Use Case analysis and researched modern design trends such as microservices, AI integration, and sustainable architecture.  

- **Joshua Mazaza (2410123):**  
  Focused on the business case, including the problem statement, proposed solution, and expected value. Conducted outsourcing analysis and provided the recommendation for nearshore outsourcing.  

- **Frank Mwelwa (2410434):**  
  Concentrated on cultural intelligence in design, ensuring inclusivity and diversity requirements. Designed and documented the DevOps/DevSecOps CI/CD pipeline. Analyzed AI opportunities and ethical concerns with proposed mitigation strategies.

## Reflection  

This report represents a **collaborative team effort**, where each member contributed both **individually** and **collectively**:  

- Each student conducted **independent research** in their respective areas before merging insights into a coherent group report.  
- The team emphasized **cross-checking each section**, ensuring that technical, cultural, and strategic perspectives complemented each other.  
- Drafts were reviewed iteratively to refine arguments, expand explanations, and maintain a consistent tone and structure across the report.  

Although limited **AI assistance** was used, its role was restricted to:  
- Helping with **formatting in Markdown (README.md)**.  
- Improving **clarity of explanations** where necessary.  
- Suggesting **expanded descriptions** to meet academic requirements.  

All **critical design decisions, technical analysis, and reasoning** were created and validated by the team members themselves. The collaboration allowed the group to **balance technical detail with practical considerations**, producing a well-rounded submission.  

The project provided valuable experience in:  
- Applying **modern design principles** (microservices, AI, DevOps).  
- Considering **cultural and ethical implications** of digital platforms.  
- Working effectively as a **multidisciplinary team** with shared ownership of outcomes.
